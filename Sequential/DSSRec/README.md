# Disentangled Self-Supervision in Sequential Recommenders

Code for paper in PyTorch ["**Disentangled Self-Supervision in Sequential Recommenders**"](http://pengcui.thumedialab.com/papers/DisentangledSequentialRecommendation.pdf)

Special thanks to [**"S3-Rec: Self-Supervised Learning for Sequential Recommendation with Mutual Information Maximization"**](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CIKM2020-S3Rec) for their code. It paved as a very useful starting point to implement code for this paper
